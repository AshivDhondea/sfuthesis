\begin{abstract}
	Youâ€™re a graduate student preparing to write your thesis or dissertation. You'd like to start writing up your amazing research results, but first there's the small matter of your university's style requirements.

	This document provides a template to help you write up your research into a thesis or dissertation. The most important part is the \texttt{sfuthesis} class, which does much of the work necessary to make your thesis conform to SFU's formatting requirements (as of 2014). The class (and this template) have been designed to be easy to use and easy to maintain, so you don't have to be a \LaTeX\ genius to make those small changes your supervisor asks for.
