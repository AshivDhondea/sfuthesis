%  PACKAGES AND CUSTOMIZATIONS  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  You don't need to call the following packages, which are already called
%  in the sfuthesis class file:
%  - etoolbox
%  - setspace
%  - enumitem
%  - pdfpages
%  - tocloft
%  - appendix
%  - cmbright or lmodern
%
%  If you call one of the above packages (or one of their dependencies)
%  with different options, you may get a "Option clash" LaTeX error.
%  If you get this error, you can fix it by removing your copy of
%  \usepackage and just passing the options you need by adding
%
%  \PassOptionsToPackage{<options>}{<package>}
%
%  before \documentclass{sfuthesis}.
