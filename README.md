thesis-template
===============

Youâ€™re a graduate student preparing to write your thesis or dissertation. Where should you start? The goal of this project --- a LaTeX class and an example template --- is to be a reasonable answer to that question. The uvicthesis class does most of the work of your thesis conform to the University of Victoria's style requirements. If for some reason you *don't* go to UVic, the clean source code should make it easy to tweak to your specific needs. 

## Installation

1. If you don't already have a LaTeX distribution, [install one][dl].

2. Download template.tex, uvicthesis.cls, and references.bib, making sure to save them in the same folder. 

3. Rename template.tex to something more suitable.

4. Delete the main content and replace it with your own.
